GENERAL:
* Make splash page which contains links to the various sims (asteroids, drumhead, planets)
* auth?

DRUMHEAD:
* connect objects with lines
* insert form fields for initial condition (IC)
* allow for introduction of damping?
* increase order of integrator?
* figure out why styling sometimes doesn't work in jsx components
* figure out why I should not decrease dt below 5 ms
* figure out why I cannot wrap objects in an svg tag
* insert arrows to indicate tangential velocity
* adjust IC by click-and-drag instead of form rilling
* adjust relative sizes of 2 types of spring constants, so that motion is isotropic (circular?)

ASTEROIDS:
* Allow two objects that "collide" (ie come within a certain distance of each other) to merge into a single object in a manner which conserves both mass (e.g., size) and momentum (= mass times velocity), and allow for the possibility that single objects may spontaneously split into two objects, again in a manner which conserved mass and momentum.

PLANETARY MOTION:
* 2-d motion of planets (using exact solution)
Stretch:
* make this 3-d
