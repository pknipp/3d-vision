# Solo React Project.
questions:
* Why doesn't "wantsEmail" boolean appear on page (although it appears on Postman)?
* Why didn't events bubble from Class-component to div in ClassList-component?
* How can I avoid having to refresh in order to empty store when logging out? (oft-stated security risk)
* How to use Components tab, w/so many things?
* How to write event-listener for checkbox arrays.
* Start to mimic BrainScape's functionality.
* Incorporate material-ui
* Change deck choice from react state to redux state.
* After a user decides to delete the subscription of a private class, in addition to the alert that they'll be deleting the class as well, give them the opportunity to cancel this entire action.
* CRUD stuff needed: User (CUD), Class (UD), Deck (CUD), Card (CRUD), History (CRU)
* Fix links on wiki.
