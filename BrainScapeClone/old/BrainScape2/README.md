4) A logged-in user will be able to subscribe to and unsubscribe from someone else's ("public") class, and in doing so add it to their "library".

5) A logged-in user will be able to ...
* choose a class in his/her library,
* select one or more decks from this class, and
* study these cards.  This last step will consist of ten "events", each of which involves his/her looking at the card's question, looking at the card's answer, and then using a 1 - 5 scale to quantify their confidence in their knowledge of that question's answer.  That per-question confidence-level will be tracked, aggregated, and reported during the study session and be incorporated into the Histories table of the database for future reference.
